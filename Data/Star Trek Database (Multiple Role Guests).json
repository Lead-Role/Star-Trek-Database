He once commented: \"I felt much more comfortable when he was an incredible giant on a screen, just a face. Suddenly when I had to account for everything else, I didn't feel support and nothing was supporting what I was doing. I was happy not to recur unless it would have gone back to a screen character\". (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages)\n\nKatsulas is best known for his role as Ambassador G'Kar on J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5. Claudia Christian, Bill Mumy, Patricia Tallman, Caitlin Brown, and Mary Kay Adams also starred in the series, which ran from 1994 through 1998.

Is unique. They tend to go with people who can operate in a strangely heightened reality and somehow make it as close to reality as you can. That's sci-fi, you know, that's what you need.\"\n\nHertzler was interviewed for the Deep Space Nine documentary What We Left Behind.\n\nHertzler made his film debut in The Redeemer (1978, starring Jeannetta Arnette). He then appeared in ...And Justice for All (1979, with Keith Andes and Robert Symonds).
